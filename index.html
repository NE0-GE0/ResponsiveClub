                <p>The Codecademy Chess Club is a place for coders to engage in the strategic mental combat 
                game of Chess.  The game of chess has been shown to improve memory, concentration, problem solving and 
                planning.  All of which are using in coding.  One German study shoed that it exercises both sides of the 
                brain.  Some even say that it grows dendrites in the brain.  One could posit that playing chess could help 
                strengthen your mind, and make you better at programming.  Games are played in person twice a week (see the
                Schedule for times and location).  You can also find a live game online through chess.com, or lichess.org.

                    GM Magnus Carlsen bounced back from his unfortunate loss by disconnect as he won all three games on 
                    the second day of the Saint Louis Rapid tournament. The world champion is now the sole leader with 9
                    points out of a possible 12.

                    GMs Ian Nepomniachtchi and Wesley So both scored "plus one" on Wednesday and are now tied for second 
                    place. The two first-day leaders, GMs Levon Aronian and Pentala Harikrishna, dropped to fourth and fifth 
                    places. GM Alireza Firouzja is still waiting for his first win.
